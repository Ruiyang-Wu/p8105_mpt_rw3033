There are total 151 observations exist in the merged data. There are 149
unique ZIP codes. There are 43 unique neighborhoods. The
total_observations should match unique_zip_codes, but in this case there
are 2 more observations. Hence, there must be duplication in zip code in
the merged data.

    ## 2       11201

“10463” and “11201” are the two repetitive zip codes. These zip codes
exist because the two regions are connected, causing them to share the
same zip code. Therefore, I will delete the rows repetitive zip code.

``` r

After the data cleaning: There are total 149 observations exist in the
merged data. There are 149 unique ZIP codes. There are 43 unique

I longer the table by date, and created a month variable. I convert the
region_name to numeric variable. For data cleaning, I kept only zip
code(region name), price (value), state, and month for further use.

# Problem 2

There are 116 months between January 2015 and August 2024, but in the
NYC Rental dataset, many ZIP codes have fewer than 116 observations.
This could be because the house may not have been rented every month.

``` r
# Get the total number of ZIP codes in zip_df
zip_zip_observations = nrow(zip_df)

# Get the total number of ZIP codes in rental_df
rental_zip_observations = nrow(rental_df)

# Get the number of ZIP codes in zip_df but not rental_df
missing_zip_rental = anti_join(zip_df, rental_df, by = c("zip_code" = "region_name"))
missing_zip_rental = nrow(missing_zip_rental)

# Get the number of ZIP codes in zip_df but not rental_df
missing_zip_zip = anti_join(rental_df, zip_df, by = c("region_name" = "zip_code"))
missing_zip_zip = nrow(missing_zip_zip)

zip_zip_observations
```

    ## [1] 322

``` r

    ## [1] 149

``` r
missing_zip_rental
```

    ## [1] 171

``` r
missing_zip_zip
```

    ## [1] 0

The total number of ZIP codes in zip_df is 322. The total number of ZIP
codes in rental_df is 149. The number of ZIP codes in zip_df but not
rental_df is 171 The number of ZIP codes in zip_df but not rental_df 0
The NYC rental dataset has fewer ZIP codes than the ZIP code dataset,
which could be because not all regions in NYC have housing rentals.

Comment: The table shows a consistent increase in rental prices across
most NYC boroughs from 2015 to 2024, with Manhattan and Brooklyn
experiencing the highest rents. Manhattan sees a sharp rise,
particularly between 2022 and 2024, reaching over \$4000, while Brooklyn
follows a steady upward trend. Queens and The Bronx also show notable
increases, though they remain more affordable compared to Manhattan and
Brooklyn. Staten Island has missing data for earlier years but sees
gradual price growth from 2020 onward. Overall, the data indicates a
competitive and rising rental market across the city.

Comment: Based on the data showing rental prices across various
neighborhoods and boroughs in New York City for 2020 and 2021, there is
a general trend of either slight decreases or moderate increases in
rental prices across most regions. Some neighborhoods like West Central
Queens and Flatbush (Brooklyn) experienced small decreases in rent from
2020 to 2021. On the other hand, some Manhattan neighborhoods, including
Lower Manhattan and Upper East Side, show a noticeable reduction in
rental prices, possibly due to the lingering effects of the COVID-19
pandemic, which caused rental market fluctuations. However, there are
some areas, such as Gramercy Park and Murray Hill (Manhattan), where
rental prices continued to rise despite these broader trends, signaling
increased demand or recovery in those areas. Overall, the data indicates
a mixed trend of recovery and stabilization across the city’s rental
market.

    ## 4 Manhattan Lower Manhattan          6334.      5422.      913.

Comment: The table reveals significant differences in rental price drops
across the boroughs from 2020 to 2021. Manhattan experienced the largest
price drop, with a sharp decline of 912.60 in Lower Manhattan. This
suggests that the rental market in Manhattan was most affected, likely
due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused many to leave
densely populated urban areas. Brooklyn, specifically in Greenpoint, saw
the second-largest drop of 437.94, indicating a substantial impact on
this neighborhood as well. Queens had a more moderate decline, with West
Central Queens experiencing a decrease of 216.97. The Bronx, on the
other hand, had the smallest decline, with Southeast Bronx seeing only a
16.46 drop, suggesting that the rental market in this borough remained
relatively stable during this period.

Comment: This plot shows the rental prices in New York City across
different ZIP codes from 2015 to 2024, differentiated by borough. We can
observe that Manhattan consistently has the highest rental prices, with
many data points above 5,000 across the years, reflecting its status as
the most expensive borough. Brooklyn and Queens generally have mid-range
prices, with Brooklyn showing more variability. The Bronx and Staten
Island consistently have the lowest rental prices, with most data points
concentrated below 3,000. The general upward trend across most boroughs
from 2020 to 2024 may reflect recovery or inflationary pressure
following the pandemic.

Comment: The violin plot shows the distribution of ZIP-code-level house
prices across different states, allowing us to easily compare the spread
and range of housing prices within each state. States like California
(CA) and New York (NY) display a wide range of house prices, with
significantly higher upper extremes compared to other states, suggesting
that these areas have some of the most expensive properties. States such
as Wyoming (WY) and West Virginia (WV) exhibit much narrower
distributions and lower median house prices, indicating less variability
and overall lower prices. The plot effectively highlights the
disparities between states, especially the stark contrast in housing
costs between high-cost states like California and low-cost states like
West Virginia.

Comment: The scatter plot demonstrates a positive correlation between
average rental prices and average housing prices across ZIP codes, as
highlighted by the upward-sloping trend line. Higher rental prices tend
to correspond with higher housing prices, though there is some
variability around the trend line, indicating that other factors may
also influence housing prices. Some ZIP codes exhibit much higher
housing prices compared to others with similar rental prices, which
could be due to regional differences, amenities, or local demand for
housing. This general upward trend suggests that areas with expensive
rental markets also tend to have higher property values.

Limitations of this dataset for understanding rental and housing prices
in NYC: 1. Missing Data: There are missing values for either rental or
housing prices for some ZIP codes, which can skew the analysis. Without
complete data for all ZIP codes, it is difficult to draw fully accurate
conclusions about price trends across the city.

2.  Lack of Borough-Level Grouping: The dataset does not group the ZIP
    codes by borough, which means that differences in rental and housing
    prices across different boroughs (e.g., Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens)
    cannot be easily analyzed. Without this grouping, regional
    differences that are essential to understanding NYC’s diverse
    housing market are less apparent.
